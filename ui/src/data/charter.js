        Everest is a shared registry of projects that is curated by registry
        members.
        <br />
        <br />
        Created to serve the Web3 ecosystem, Everest aims to provide
        transparency about organizations and communities and to be the go-to
        source for verifiable information. This will include project details,
        links, job postings, events and more. As Everest grows, so will its
        utility as other decentralized applications and on-chain data is
        integrated with registry projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        Projects to be listed on Everest include any organizations building on
        decentralized technology, integrating cryptocurrencies or supporting the
        growth of Web3. Everest will be composed of but is not limited to
        decentralized applications, protocols, NGOs, research organizations,
        venture and hedge funds. Web3 can include distributed systems, p2p
        networking or blockchain technology. Projects can be mapped to
        categories and sub-categories to allow for easy search and clear
        categorization of projects across Web3 verticals.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Everest Registry uses the ERC-1056 identity standard for projects to
        enable composability of project identity across other decentralized
        applications.

        Everest's mission is to curate a shared registry of projects that are
        operational and high-quality. The value of Everest to the broader
        ecosystem depends on the integrity and accuracy of information in
        project listings.
        <br />
        <br />
        Everest is composed of the community's efforts to create a reliable
        tracker of organizations working together.
        <br />
        <br />
        Projects should have accurate details: name, description, project logo
        and image and correct links to the website, Github and Twitter. Projects
        should also be assigned categories and sub-categories based on the
        verticals they belong to.
        <br />
        <br />
        At all times, the Everest registry is being curated. If projects have
        inaccurate information or are being fraudulently misrepresented, a
        registry member can challenge the project requiring other members to
        vote on the validity of the listing.

        All users are incentivized to maintain the list's quality since there is
        limited advantage to...
        <br />
        <br /> Everest is building toward a decentralized future where no
        privileged group has control over public data. The Everest registry aims
        to be a public dataset about projects, that is maintained by diverse
        stakeholders who agree on the contents of the shared registry with
        neutrality.
        <br />
        <br />
        Anyone can add a project to Everest by paying a 10 DAI listing fee to
        the Everest Reserve Bank. The listing fee helps ensure skin in the game
        for maintaining the registry's quality. If a project representative (eg.
        an employee, contractor, investor) adds the project, makes sure to claim
        the project so others know that the listing will be maintained by the
        native project.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once a project is added, the project owner can help maintain Everest's
        quality by challenging existing projects on the registry or voting on
        challenges, on behalf of the project. Registry listings should only be
        challenged if there is reasonable belief that the project does not
        belong on the Everest registry:
        <br />
        <br />
        a) the project details are inaccurate (eg. outdated information, broken
        links)
        <br /> b) the project's categories or sub-categories are inaccurate
        <br /> c) the project is being fraudulently misrepresented
        <br />
        <br />
        Anyone can challenge a listing by staking 10 DAI. If the challenge is
        successful, the stake is returned and the challenger is awarded 1 DAI.
        If the challenge is unsuccessful, the challenger loses their stake and
        it's added to the Everest Reserve Bank. Once a challenge is complete,
        any user can also resolve a challenge and earn 1 DAI for resolving
        complete challenges.
        <br />
        <br /> Owners can vote on behalf of multiple projects or they can
        delegate their voting rights. Each project's vote is weighted by time,
        derived from how long the project has been a part of the Everest
        registry.

        Everest was developed by The Graph and MetaCartel and will be maintained
        by the community. The goal of Everest is to integrate project identities
        with other useful applications and protocols. As a result, the Everest
        Reserve Bank and community grants will be used to fund bounties to build
        greater functionality into the Everest registry.
